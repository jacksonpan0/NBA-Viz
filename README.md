# NBA-Viz

## Purpose
This program aims to identify and visualize players' impact on their team's performance. This impact is calculated through a novel formula 
accounting for the team's overall performance in a specific season.

## How to Access
While NBA Viz currently only exists on local servers, I intend to have a website running soon.
